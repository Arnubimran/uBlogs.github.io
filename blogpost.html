Like other uniforms, it identifies the group in which they are members, in this case their baseball team. Most baseball uniforms have the last names and uniform numbers of players who wear them. The names and numbers are usually on the back to identify each player. Baseball shirts, pants, shoes, socks, caps, and helmets are parts of the uniform. Players also wear gloves, but they are not part of the uniform, because players can choose their own gloves. Most uniforms have different logos and colors to show which team it is.[1] <br>

            Baseball uniforms were first worn by the New York Knickerbockers Baseball Club in the 1840s. Their uniforms were pants made of blue wool, white flannel shirts and straw hats.[2][3][4] Since then, the uniforms have gone through many changes.[5] More items, ideas, and many other improvements were done and added to these uniforms over the years. Their style also changed, little by little over time.[2] <br>
            
            History
            Creation
            On April 4, 1849,[2] the New York Knickerbockers became the first team to use uniforms.[4][6][7] In 1882, different colors that showed the different fielding positions of each player were added on uniforms and stockings (garment covering the foot and lower part of the leg).[8] In 1888 and 1889, the Detroit Wolverines and Washington Nationals of the National League and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the American Association added stripes to their uniforms.[2][4][9][10] By 1900, all players in Major League Baseball teams were using uniforms.[11] <br>
            Pinstripes and numbers <br>
            Pinstriping (long vertical stripes along uniforms) were created in the 19th century.[15] They were first worn on some major league baseball team's uniforms in 1907.[4][12] The pinstripes were soon widened in 1912, so that people could see them more easily.[12] Pinstriping was used again when the Brooklyn Bridegrooms started to wear them in 1907, 1916 and 1917.[2][10] During that time when the striped uniforms were made again, other things for the baseball uniform were added, such as satin.[2][10][16] The team that often wore pinstripes was the New York Yankees. They were first used in 1912. But the Yankees' pinstripes (on their home uniforms) have become a symbol of the Yankees.[15] Because of that, books about the Yankees started to be made with pinstriped covers.[15]</p>
